          <p>Applications Research Group</p>

          <p>
            People at Protocol Labs build protocols, tools, and services to radically improve the
            Internet. The Applications Research Group (ARG) is an auxiliary team that aims to
            bolsters the mission by focusing on shipping tools that people love to use on the
            Internet.
          </p>

          <p>
            The ARG's work has the potential to serve a lot of people. Over four billion people are
            active internet users as of 2020, and that value is over fifty five percent of the
            global population. Our civilization reached this point by creating an Internet with no
            single centralized governance by either technological implementation or government
            policy. We believe that in order to continue an open global Internet, we must ship more
            well designed software and utilize protocols that preserve what everyone cherishes.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Applications Research Group's stance towards Web3 Applications is simple. Internet
            software today can be better. We believe in open source software, and we believe you
            should have much more autonomy over your clients. People should not provide sensitive
            data to Internet services unless it is absolutely necessary, and then only if they
            choose to. If a person uses software they can become transformed into a product against
            their will. Client‚áÑserver architecture has gotten us far, but there no longer needs to
            be a single point of failure for services, and the new clients need to be far more
            robust to handle the world of augmented and virtual reality. People deserve transparency
            from their software, just like they deserve to know what chemicals are in their food, or
            which pollutants are in the water they drink.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our group gets to use libraries and modules from Protocol Labs, which have honored the
            tradition of searching for optimal Web3 infrastructure. We are excited for the
            opportunity to continue to battle test Filecoin, IPFS, LIBP2P, IPLD, and other
            contributions by the many forward thinking engineers and software designers who work
            here. Quality technology deserves an audience.
          </p>

          <p>
            Groups like Textile, Fleek, and Infinite Scroll (to name a few) are inspiring and
            leading the way in more ways than we can list. Their services make what the Applications
            Research Group does possible. Our first product in 2020,{" "}
            <a href="https://slate.host" target="_blank">
              https://slate.host
            </a>
            , proves that we can incorporate many services into a single compelling end-user
            product. From there we were able to kick it off to stewards that are fully capable of
            maintaining and owning the project. In 2021 we hope to build many new projects that help
            expand the ecosystem and opportunities to learn together.
          </p>
